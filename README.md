# Midi-chlorian PowerShell Color Scheme
An .itermcolors theme designed specifically for use with standard PowerShell syntax. Inspired by Darth Revan, and my mental visualization of the Force as used by a Force user who walked the path between Dark and Light exported into colors.

Yes, I'm a nerd. No, I'm not sorry. :)

To be used with the [Windows Console Color Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/releases). Instructions below.

---

## Instructions

• Download the [Windows Console Color Tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/releases).

• Extract the `colortool.exe` file, and the `schemes` folder, from the downloaded zip.

• Download, or create, the `midichlorian.itermcolors` file/source code from this repo. If you create the itermcolors file yourself, note that .itermcolors is the file extension.

• Place the downloaded/created `midichlorian.itermcolors` file into the `scheme` folder that was extracted from the Windows Console Color Tool zip file.

• Open PowerShell, and navigate to the directory where you extracted `colortool.exe` and the `schemes` folder to.

• Run the following command: `.\colortool.exe midichlorian.itermcolors`

• If the terminal doesn't match the screenshot below, right click the terminal and click `Properties` and then select the `Colors` tab. Make sure that the first box, in the row of colored boxes, is highlighted.

#### Author's note: As with everything else, make sure you further customize your PowerShell terminal by selecting an easily readable font, and making sure that your font size is large enough that you don't have to squint at it to read it. Seriously... do your eyes a favor, and set it to at least 14pt. I personally like Consolas myself.

#### Author's note #2: Feel free to tweak, modify, and distribute this however you like. Make life easy: Use [Terminal.Sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) to tweak it to perfection.
